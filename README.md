# Minced

Here I try out the nodejs npm module **mincer**.


### Instructions

Edit the `assets` dir in much the same way you would in a asset piepline enabled rails app. Then in the console run:

```bash
npm install
node minced.js
```

You should get your assets spat back out at you.

The code provided shows

- the node evironment can be accessed at compile time via `ejs`
- `less` integration
- javascript minification

# w00t!
